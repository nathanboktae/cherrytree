### v2.0.0-alpha.13

* Make params, query and route array immutable between transitions, i.e. modifying those directly on the transition only affects that transition
* Replace `paramNames` with `params` in the route descriptor
* Drop the `ancestors` attribute from the route descriptor
* Drop out of the box support for ES3 environments (IE8), to use Cherrytree - es5 polyfills for native `map`, `reduce` and `forEach` need to be used now. This was possible always the case since usage of babel requires an es5 environment.

### v2.0.0-alpha.12

* BYOP - Cherrytree now requires a global Promise implementation to be available or a Promise constructor passed in as an option

### v2.0.0-alpha.11

* Add `transition.redirectTo` so that middleware could initiate redirects without having the router

### v2.0.0-alpha.10

* Log errors by default (i.e. options.logError: true by default)

### v2.0.0-alpha.9

* Fix router.destroy() - DOM click events for link interception are now cleaned up when router.destroy() is called
* Add server side support
  * events.js now exports an {} object on the server instead of crashing due to missing `window`
  * MemoryLocation correctly handles option flags and can be instantiated with a starting `path`
* Add a [server-side-react example](../examples/server-side-react)
* When transition is rejected with a `TransitionRedirected` error - the `err.nextPath` is now available)

### v2.0.0-alpha.8

* Fix dependencies - lodash was declared as a devDependency

### v2.0.0-alpha.7

* Fix the URL generation when `pushState: true` and root !== '/'

### v2.0.0-alpha.1

A brand new and improved cherrytree!
